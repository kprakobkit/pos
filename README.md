# To run the app, follow these steps:

1. Run 'go setup'.
2. Open three terminal windows.
3. Run one of the three commands in each window: 'go client', 'go server', and 'go mongo'.
4. Open localhost:8081 and start developing.

You should see live reload when you make changes to the client code, as well as the server code.
